#
# The Dockerfile is a multistage one to keep the image size as small as possible. 
# It starts with a build image based on golang:alpine. 
# The resulting binary is used in the second image, which is just a scratch one. 
# A scratch image contains no dependencies or libraries, 
# just the binary file that starts the application.
